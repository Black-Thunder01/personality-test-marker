•	I find it difficult to understand information the bank sends me on
different investment and saving systems.

appliances together.

 hard disc drive capacity and processor speed.

Negatively scored items: 1,3,4,6,10

An SQ was calculated by summing the responses.

"I find it difficult to understand information the bank sends me on different investment and saving systems."

"I do not enjoy games that involve a high degree of strategy (e.g. chess,Risk, Games Workshop)" changed to "I do not enjoy games that involve a high degree of strategy (e.g. chess,Risk,poker)"

For + keyed items, the response "Very Inaccurate" is assigned a value of 1, "Moderately Inaccurate" a value of 2, "Neither Inaccurate nor Accurate" a 3, "Moderately Accurate" a 4, and "Very Accurate" a value of 5.

For - keyed items, the response "Very Inaccurate" is assigned a value of 5, "Moderately Inaccurate" a value of 4, "Neither Inaccurate nor Accurate" a 3, "Moderately Accurate" a 2, and "Very Accurate" a value of 1.

Once numbers are assigned for all of the items in the scale,  sum all the values to obtain a total scale score.

"19. I seldom feel blue" to "19. I seldom feel blue (down)"
"27.I have a soft heart" to "I have a soft (kind) heart"

"49. I often feel blue" to "49. I often feel blue (down)"

##Open Extended Jungian Type Scales 1.2

This is an interactive version of the Open Extended Jungian Type Scales 1.2,
an alternative to the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator.
This test has 62 items in two sections, opposing characteristics and first-person personality descriptions.

The OEJTS measures four scale, each of which is a dichotomy:
Introversion (I) vs. Extroversion (E); sometimes described as a persons orientation, either oriented inside themselves or to the outside world. Other times the focus is put more explicitly on social interaction, with some claiming that social interactions wears out introverts whereas social interaction raises the energy level in extroverts.

Sensing (S) vs. Intuition (N); defined as how a person takes in information by Myers-Briggs, who said that sensors pay attention to the five senses while intuitives pay attention to possibilities.

Feeling (F) vs. Thinking (T); has been defined as what a person values and what they base their decisions off of: either interpersonal considerations or through dispassionate logic.

Judging (J) vs. Perceiving (P);  was a dichotomy added by Myers and Briggs to pick between the second and third pair of functions. Individuals who prefer a structured lifestyle are supposed to use their judging functions (thinking and feeling) while individuals who prefer a flexible lifestyle are supposed to prefer the sensing functions (sensing and intuition).
